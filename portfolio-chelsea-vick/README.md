Reflection
What is working well so far:
The overall layout and structure of the site are working well. Navigation between pages is functional and consistent, the HTML uses semantic elements appropriately, and the CSS is organized and reusable across pages. The site matches my mockup and visual goals pretty well so far, and I’m happy with how the header, gallery grid, and form styling turned out. Responsiveness is also working at a very basic level across screen sizes.

What is still incomplete or challenging:
The main remaining work involves adding content and interactivity. I still need to select and add images of my best artwork to populate the gallery, as well as include either a photo of myself or a finalized logo I am currently working on in my other class to the about page. I also plan to implement a lightbox-style gallery with navigation arrows for viewing the illustrations, which will need some JavaScript to work properly. Since we haven't covered JavaScript yet in class, I'm not fully comfortable implementing that at this stage. Also, I plan to add a hamburger menu for mobile navigation, but the current navigation works well for now as a starting point.

Notes for the Instructor
This site is intentionally about 90% complete and will continue to be refined and expanded throughout the semester (and maybe even through next school year) as we cover JavaScript and more advanced techniques.
